Q: What are activity logs used for?
A: Activity logs track all system actions for security auditing, troubleshooting, and compliance purposes.

Q: Why should I check privacy consents?
A: Privacy consents ensure compliance with the Data Privacy Act. They record when parents agreed to data processing terms.

Q: Can I edit multiple accounts at once?
A: No, you can only edit one account at a time. However, you can delete multiple accounts at once using bulk selection.

Q: How do I change a user's role (e.g., from User to BHW or Midwife)?
A: Go to the appropriate management page (Users, BHW, or Midwife), click "Edit" on the account, change the Role dropdown to the desired role, and click "Update". The account will be moved to the corresponding management section.

Q: What happens when I change a user's role?
A: When you change a User to BHW or Midwife, the system adds the account to the bhw or midwives table while preserving the original user data in the users table. This allows the person to switch roles between Parent and BHW/Midwife. The account will appear in the corresponding management page. The user will need to log out and log back in to see their new role.

Q: Can I change a BHW to a Midwife or vice versa?
A: Yes, you can change roles between User, BHW, and Midwife. Simply edit the account and select the new role from the dropdown. If the person was originally a User, their user account data remains, allowing them to switch back to Parent role.

Q: Why can some BHW/Midwives switch to Parent role?
A: If a BHW or Midwife was originally created as a User, their user data remains in the users table even after being converted to BHW or Midwife. This dual-account setup allows them to switch between roles using the "Switch Role" feature in their profile menu. This is intentional to allow flexibility for users who may need both roles.

Q: What happens if system settings are incorrect?
A: Users will not receive OTP codes, password reset links, or notifications. Always test settings after updating them.
